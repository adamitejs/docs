# SDK

<span className="lead">
  Adamite's SDK strives to be easy to understand by following some consistent
  patterns.
</span>

## Get an app instance

<section>

<div>

When you call the `adamite` function, it returns an App. An App is the root of the Adamite SDK.

</div>

```js
const app = adamite();
```

</section>

### Using multiple apps

<section>

<div>

The Adamite SDK supports connecting to multiple instances from one client. When calling `adamite`, you can optionally
pass an app name as a string to clarify which app instance you want to access. If you don't pass a string, the app name `default` is used.

</div>

```js
const secondaryApp = adamite("secondary");
```

</section>

## Access core services

<section>

<div>

Once you have an App instance, you can access the core service plugins with convenience methods.

</div>

```js
// access the database plugin
const database = adamite().database();

// access the functions plugin
const functions = adamite().functions();

// access the auth plugin
const auth = adamite().auth();
```

</section>

## Access custom plugins

<section>

<div>

You can access custom plugins using the `plugin` method.

</div>

```js
const customPlugin = adamite().plugin("customPlugin");
```

</section>
