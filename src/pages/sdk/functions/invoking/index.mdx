# Invoking functions

<span className="lead">
  Functions are powerful pieces of server-side logic that you can call or invoke
  from your app. Anything that you can't do with the database system directly,
  you should be able to do with functions.
</span>

<section>

<div>

To invoke a function, call the `invoke` method. You can pass a single argument to the function (which can be an object or an array if you choose). Whatever the function returns will be returned as a resolved promise.

```jsx
import adamite from "@adamite/sdk";

const result = await adamite()
  .functions()
  .invoke("add", [1, 2]);

console.log(result); // 3
```
