# Modifying data

<span className="lead">
  You can create, update, and delete documents in Adamite by creating a
  reference to that data. Once you have a reference, you can modify the
  underlying data with the SDK.
</span>

## Create a reference

### Reference a collection

<section>

<div>

You can reference a collection of documents by calling the `collection`
method.

</div>

```jsx
import adamite from "@adamite/sdk";

const usersRef = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("user");
```

</section>

### Reference a document

<section>

<div>

Once you have a collection reference, you can reference an individual document in that collection using the `doc` method.

</div>

```jsx
const usersRef = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("user")
  .doc("document_id");
```

</section>

## Create new documents in a collection

<section>

<div>

You can create a new document in a collection by calling the `create` method on a reference to that collection. Once created, a snapshot of the new document is returned.

</div>

```jsx
adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("users")
  .create({
    name: "John Smith",
    age: 23,
    email: "john@gmail.com"
  });
```

</section>

## Update a document

<section>

<div>

You can update a document by calling the `update` method on a reference to that document. Once updated, a snapshot of the new document is returned.

</div>

```jsx
adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("users")
  .doc("document_id")
  .update({ age: 25 });
```

</section>

## Delete a document

<section>

<div>

You can delete a document by calling the `delete` method on a reference to that document.

</div>

```jsx
adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("users")
  .doc("document_id")
  .delete();
```

</section>
