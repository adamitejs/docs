# Filtering data

<span className="lead">
  When referencing a collection, you may want to add certain filters to that
  reference. Filters limit the number of documents that show up in that
  collection.
</span>

<section>

<div>

Start out by referencing a collection. You can only apply filters to a collection reference.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts");
```

</section>

## Filter by a property

<section>

<div>

You can filter a collection by properties on its documents using the `filter` method.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .where("title", "==", "My First Post");
```

</section>

<br /><br />

<section>

<div>

You can filter by multiple properties as well by chaining calls to `where`.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .where("title", "==", "My First Post")
  .where("subtitle", "==", "An exercise in testing.");
```

</section>

## Sort documents in the collection

<section>

<div>

You can change how the documents are sorted using the `orderBy` method. Available operations include `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>` and `<`.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .orderBy("title", "asc"); // or "desc"
```

</section>

## Limit the number of returned documents

<section>

<div>

By default, only the top 1000 documents will be returned in a snapshot. You can increase or decrease this amount using the `limit` function.

<Callout intent={Intent.PRIMARY} icon={null}>
  The maximum allowed limit is currently 10000 documents. Setting the limit
  higher than this will not work. Eventually, support for pagination will be
  included.
</Callout>

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .limit(10);
```

</section>
