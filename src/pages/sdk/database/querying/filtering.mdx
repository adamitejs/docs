# Filtering data

<span className="lead">
  When referencing a collection, you may want to add certain filters to that
  reference. Filters limit the number of documents that show up in that
  collection.
</span>

<section>

<div>

Start out by referencing a collection. You can only apply filters to a collection reference.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts");
```

</section>

## Filter by a property

<section>

<div>

You can filter a collection by properties on its documents using the `where` method.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .where("title", "==", "My First Post");
```

</section>

<section>

<div>

You can filter by multiple properties as well by chaining calls to `where`.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .where("title", "==", "My First Post")
  .where("subtitle", "==", "An exercise in testing.");
```

</section>
