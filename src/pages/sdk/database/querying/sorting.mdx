# Sorting documents in a collection

<span className="lead">
  When referencing a collection, you may want to change the order that documents
  are returned in.
</span>

<section>

<div>

Start out by referencing a collection. You can only apply ordering rules to a collection reference.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts");
```

</section>

## Order by a property

<section>

<div>

You can order a collection by properties on its documents using the `orderBy` method.

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .orderBy("name", "asc");
```

</section>
