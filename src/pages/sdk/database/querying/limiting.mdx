# Limiting the number of documents returned

<span className="lead">
  When referencing a collection, you may want to limit the snapshot to a certain
  number of documents.
</span>

<section>

<div>

You can limit the number of documents by calling the `limit` function on a collection reference.

By default, only the top 1000 documents will be returned in a snapshot. You can increase or decrease this amount using the `limit` function.

<Callout intent={Intent.PRIMARY} icon={null}>
  The maximum allowed limit is currently 10000 documents. Setting the limit
  higher than this will not work. Eventually, support for pagination will be
  included.
</Callout>

</div>

```jsx
const postsReference = adamite()
  .database()
  .collection("posts")
  .limit(50);
```

</section>
