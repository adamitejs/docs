# Database

<span className="lead">
  You can create, read, update, delete, and subscribe to data in your database
  using the Adamite SDK.
</span>

## Access the database

<section>

<div>
  You can access the database using the `database` method on an app instance.
</div>

```js
const database = adamite().database();
```

</section>

## Accessing other databases

<section>

<div>
  Your app can have multiple databases and the SDK can access them. To use a
  different database, pass the database's name to the `database` method. If you
  don't pass a name, the default database will be used.
</div>

```js
const otherDatabase = adamite().database("other");
```

</section>
