# Adamite

<span className="lead">
  Adamite is a self-hosted platform as a service (PaaS) designed to let quickly
  prototype ideas and focus on writing your app.
</span>

<section>

<div>

To get started with Adamite, we recommend downloading the [`start`](https://github.com/adamitejs/start) boilerplate. It's pre-configured to give you access to all of Adamite's core services.

<Button
  large
  text="Download Adamite Boilerplate"
  icon="import"
  onClick={() =>
    window.open("https://github.com/adamitejs/start/archive/master.zip")
  }
/>

</div>

```bash
wget https://github.com/adamitejs/start/archive/master.zip

unzip master.zip my-app/
```
