# Get Started

<span className="lead">
  To start working with Adamite, you'll need to set up an Adamite instance.
</span>

<section>

<div>

The quickest way to get started is to download the Adamite starter template. It's preconfigured with all of Adamite's core services. We suggest using `degit` to clone the repo...

</div>

```bash
# degit the starter template
npx degit adamitejs/start your-app-name

# navigate to your new project
cd your-app-name/
```

</section>

## Install dependencies

<section>

<div>

An Adamite instance is a self-contained NPM package. You can install its dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

</div>

```bash
# Using NPM
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install
```

</section>

## Install RethinkDb

<section>

<div>

Adamite's database uses RethinkDb under the hood, so you'll need to have a RethinkDB server installed.

<Button large text="Install RethinkDb" rightIcon="arrow-top-right" />

<br /><br />

<Callout title="Configuring the connection" intent={Intent.PRIMARY} icon={null}>
  By default, Adamite will connect to a locally running RethinkDB instance if
  one exists. You can customize this by changing the adamite.js config file.
</Callout>

</div>

</section>

---

## Start the instance

<section>

<div>

Once everything is installed, you can run your Adamite server using `npm` or `yarn`.

</div>

```bash
# Using NPM
npm start

# Using Yarn
yarn start
```

</section>

---

## Obtain an SDK key

<section>

<div>

On first run, Adamite will generate an SDK key for you to use. The SDK key will be printed in the console when you run your app. You can use the Adamite SDK and that SDK key to connect a client to your instance.

<Button
  large
  rightIcon="arrow-top-right"
  text="Get started with the SDK"
  onClick={() => navigate("/sdk")}
/>

</div>

</section>
