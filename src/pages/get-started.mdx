# Get Started

<span className="lead">
  To start working with Adamite, you'll need to set up an Adamite instance.
</span>

<section>

<div>

The quickest way to get started is to download the Adamite starter template. It's preconfigured with all of Adamite's core services.

<Button
  large
  text="Download Adamite Boilerplate"
  icon="import"
  onClick={() =>
    window.open("https://github.com/adamitejs/start/archive/master.zip")
  }
/>

</div>

```bash
# Download the template
wget https://github.com/adamitejs/start/archive/master.zip

# Extract it!
unzip master.zip your-app
```

## Install dependencies

<section>

<div>

An Adamite instance is a self-contained NPM package. You can install its dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

</div>

```bash
# Using NPM
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install
```

</section>

## Install RethinkDb

<section>

<div>

Adamite's database uses RethinkDb under the hood, so you'll need to have a RethinkDB server installed.

<Button large text="Install RethinkDb" rightIcon="arrow-top-right" />

<br /><br />

<Callout title="Configuring the connection" intent={Intent.PRIMARY} icon={null}>
  By default, Adamite will connect to a locally running RethinkDB instance if
  one exists. You can customize this by changing the adamite.js config file.
</Callout>

</div>

</section>

---

## Start the instance

<section>

<div>

Once everything is installed, you can run your Adamite server using `npm` or `yarn`.

</div>

```bash
# Using NPM
npm start

# Using Yarn
yarn start
```

</section>

---

## Obtain an SDK key

<section>

<div>

On first run, Adamite will generate an SDK key for you to use. You can view this key by opening `data/api.json`. Once you have this key, you can connect to your Adamite instance using the Adamite SDK.

<Button
  large
  rightIcon="arrow-top-right"
  text="Get started with the SDK"
  onClick={() => navigate("/sdk")}
/>

</div>

</section>
