# Securing Reads

<span className="lead">
  When you request a snapshot from the database, it will first check to see if
  the relevant collection has a read rule.
</span>

## Basic read rule

<section>

<div>

To secure reads, you can add a `read` rule to a collection. Regardless of if a collection is queried or an individual document is queried, the rule will be ran. Additionally, the rule will be ran per document, allowing you to filter certain documents out of a collection query.

</div>

```js
module.exports = {
  default: {
    posts: {
      read: ({ client }) => {
        // allow posts to be read by authenticated users only
        return !!client.auth;
      }
    }
  }
};
```

</section>

## More examples

### Only allow owners to read a document

<section>

<div>

Check that the requesting user is authorized and is the owner of the document.

</div>

```js
read: ({ client }, { data }) => {
  return !!client.auth && client.auth.sub === data.owner;
};
```

</section>

### Implement soft deletion

<section>

<div>

Only allow reads for files that don't have a `deleted` flag.

</div>

```js
read: (req, { data }) => {
  return !data.deleted;
};
```

</section>

### Restrict reading to those with a certain role

<section>

<div>

You can reference other data in the database using the Adamite SDK.

</div>

```js
import adamite from "@adamite/sdk";

read: async ({ client }) => {
  if (!!client.auth) {
    return false;
  }

  const userSnap = await adamite()
    .database()
    .collection("users")
    .doc(client.auth.sub)
    .get();

  return userSnap.data.role === "admin";
};
```

</section>
